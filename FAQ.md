# FAQ

## Is this the product?
No. This is the **execution hub**. Product repos may live elsewhere, but the governance and verification layer lives here.

## Why make impact verifiable?
Because trust compounds. If we claim value, we should be able to prove integrity and provenance.

## Do receipts guarantee correctness?
No. They guarantee integrity and traceability (what file, what hash, what record). Correctness is still a human responsibility.

## What does "$1T" mean?
It means we design for scale, not vibes. Big value must be matched with big responsibility.
