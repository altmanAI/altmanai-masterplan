# Principles

AltmanAI operates from a simple ethical anchor:

**Humanity leads. Intelligence follows.**

## Non-negotiables
1) **Human dignity and well-being first.**
2) **Truthful systems**: no hype; claims must be measurable or clearly labeled as hypotheses.
3) **Explainability by default**: decisions and outputs should be understandable to a reasonable person.
4) **Privacy and security**: minimize data; protect what exists; do responsible disclosure.
5) **Receipts over rhetoric**: prefer verifiable artifacts (hashes, logs, provenance) to marketing.

## How this shows up in practice
- We use PAIHI to publish verifiable impact entries.
- We ship weekly, then refine based on feedback and measurements.
- We treat safety as a product feature, not a disclaimer.
