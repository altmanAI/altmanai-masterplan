# Vision

AltmanAI exists to build **human-first AI** that makes life simpler, calmer, and more capable.

## The $1T mandate (what it means here)
"$1T" is not a slogan. It is a constraint: we aim for systems that can scale to massive economic and social value **without sacrificing human dignity**.

We do this by:
- Building products that reduce friction (DailyPilot)
- Publishing verifiable proof of impact (Impact Explorer + PAIHI)
- Turning civic information into transparent, traceable knowledge (Civic Knowledge Engine)

## The loop
**Build -> Measure -> Prove -> Scale**
