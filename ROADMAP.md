# ROADMAP (90 Days)

Start date: 2025-12-13

We operate on a simple rule: **Ship weekly. Measure weekly. Improve weekly.**  
This roadmap is designed to produce visible proof, compounding trust, and real product momentum.

## North Star outcomes (90 days)
1) Public, verifiable Proof-of-Impact pipeline (PAIHI) that anyone can audit.
2) A working Impact Explorer (lite) showing real entries end-to-end.
3) DailyPilot v0.1 planning spec locked + initial prototype started.
4) Civic Knowledge Engine scoped + first dataset ingestion proof.

## Week-by-week

### Week 1: Repo becomes the execution OS
- [ ] Finalize governance + contribution workflow
- [ ] PAIHI spec (public-safe) + JSON schemas + examples
- [ ] Tools: generate receipt, verify receipt, validate registry
- [ ] First Build Log in `logs/`

### Week 2: Impact Explorer (lite) ships
- [ ] `impact/registry.jsonl` (or folder records) format finalized
- [ ] CLI to render a readable report from impact entries
- [ ] Add an "Integrity Check" GitHub Action

### Week 3: DailyPilot spec -> prototype
- [ ] `projects/dailypilot/NORTH_STAR.md`
- [ ] v0.1 UX + core loop definition
- [ ] Decide: SwiftUI-only prototype vs. cross-platform demo

### Week 4: Civic Knowledge Engine v0.1 scope
- [ ] Identify 1 civic dataset + ingestion plan
- [ ] Define traceability model: source -> transform -> claim

### Weeks 5-8: Build + iterate
- [ ] Weekly releases of Impact Explorer features
- [ ] PAIHI refinements (compat, clarity, minimalism)
- [ ] DailyPilot prototype progress + usability notes

### Weeks 9-13: Productization pressure
- [ ] Solidify 1 "public demo" narrative per track
- [ ] Tighten security, privacy, disclosure, and trust posture
- [ ] Prepare for partnerships and pilot users

## Definition of Done (weekly)
- Build Log published
- One measurable outcome shipped (code/docs/data)
- One impact record added (public-safe)
- One risk reviewed (safety/ethics/privacy)
